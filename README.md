A Simple project to solve an issue of choosing a lunch spot with my colleagues when working in the office. 
A simple project which includes top restaurants from certain malls, dark and light mode, animations as well as ability to customise wheel
All using only HTML,CSS and Javascript. 
Future Improvements: 
1. Search for  top restaurants in the select shopping malls and immediately load it in
2. Automatically suggest restaurants and malls based on current location
3. Filters for Food type, price range, distance and local review
4. Profiles to save custom configurations and access on any device
5. Proper hosting with simple database and ad services
